      <h1>Hi there, ðŸ‘‹</h1>
      <p className={styles.grid}>
        My name is Jean and I am a software engineer with a background
        in Internet Systems. I have a passion for front-end development and have
        experience working with various frameworks, including Vue, React, Next,
        and Angular. Currently, I am working as a front end engineer at a big
        retail company in Brazil where I utilize React, Next, and GraphQL on a
        daily basis. I am always looking to learn and grow as a developer, and
        am excited to see what the future holds for me in this ever-evolving
        field. =)
